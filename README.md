# SG_streets
An evaluation set for speech recognition experiments used in [1]. This set contains 6 interview sessions (close talk microphone) of Singaporean students reading passages about Singapore streets. Each interview sessions consists of 2 recordings corresponding to interviewer and interviewee.

## Other notes:
- Compound street names are combined using underscore symbol, i.e. 'boon lay' -> 'boon_lay'.
- To simulate the scenario where these street names are rare words, ensure that they are absent or appear a few times (1-3) in the train set.
- The main application of the evaluation set is to correctly recognize these street names while preserving the WER.
- List of named entities are given in file *named_entities.txt*.
- List of other Singapore street names can be found in: https://geographic.org/streetview/singapore/
- The pronunciation lexicon can be obtained from G2P models such as http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lextool.html. E.g. for word "boon_lay", first generate pronunciation lexicon of "boon" and "lay" separately, and then combine all pronunciation variations.
- The readers are Singaporeans (accent is different from English speakers in other countries), and thus train set containing Singapore English is recommended, e.g. https://www2.imda.gov.sg/NationalSpeechCorpus. (Note: in the paper we used strong Singapore English ASR trained on our own dataset).
